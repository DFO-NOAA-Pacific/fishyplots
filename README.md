This repository is a collection of plotting functions for the [Pacific Groundfish Data Synopsis Shiny app](https://github.com/DFO-NOAA-Pacific/shinyfishyplots), led by [Zoe Khan](https://github.com/ZoeKhan1) and [Callie Murakami](https://github.com/calmurakami). 

The concept and code are heavily inspired by Fisheries and Oceans Canada's annual [Pacific Groundfish Data Synopsis Reports](https://github.com/pbs-assess/gfsynopsis) and the paper:

Anderson, S.C., Keppel, E.A., and Edwards, A.M. 2020. Reproducible visualization of raw fisheries data for 113 species improves transparency, assessment efficiency, and monitoring. Fisheries 45: 535â€“543. <https://doi.org/10.1002/fsh.10441> [[PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-eLZFvEK9FxrKJPQ-AiojI30siYyfrUr/view?usp=sharing)].

This work also builds off of initial NOAA implementation from 2024 of the synopsis report concept by
[Chantel Wetzel](https://github.com/DFO-NOAA-Pacific/gfsynopsis-noaa) and [Matt Callahan](https://github.com/MattCallahan-NOAA/gapproductssynopsis).
